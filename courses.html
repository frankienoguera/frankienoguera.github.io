        <ul>
          <li><strong>MATH 1200: Statistics I</strong><br>
            Learned Statistics
          </li>
          <li><strong>MAT 232: Linear Algebra</strong><br>
            Learned matrix methods; algebra of matrices, determinants, finding solutions of systems of linear equations and eigenvalue problems; 
            vector spaces and linear transformations; classification of matrices
          </li>
          <li><strong>CPS 121: Intro to Programming</strong><br>
            Learned Python, fundamental theories to computer proframming such as:
            nature of algorithms, essential control structures and data representation.
          </li>
          <li><strong>DSC 210: Data Wrangling</strong><br>
            Introduces concepts and techniques used to manipulate tabular and hierarchical data.<br> 
            Explores methods in data acquisition (web scraping, data APIs, relational databases with SQL) and transformation with explicit consideration of diverse data types.<br> 
            Best practices related to documentation and data provenance are emphasized.
          </li>
          <li><strong>DSC 211: Modeling and Visualization</strong><br>
            Introduces fundamental concepts and techniques related to modeling and data visualization. 
            Topics include linear and logistic regression modeling workflows, data visualization theory, and applied animation and interactivity. 
          </li>
          <li><strong>CPS 330: Machine Learning</strong><br>
            In this class we covered topics such as:
            Supervised learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Networks. <br>
            Additionally I also learned regression, classification, clustering, and ensemble methods. <br>
            Along with learning how to use tools like Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebooks, Keras, TensorFLow, and Google Colab.
          </li>
          <li><strong>DSC 440: Data Science Project</strong><br>
            Data management and manipulation using Python/R and tools for working with large data sets. 
          </li>
          <li><strong>COM 205: Communication Theory</strong><br>
            Learned foundational concepts and methods for understanding and evaluating communication with a focus on theory relevant to visual storytelling.
          </li>
          <li><strong>COM 222: Journalsim</strong><br>
            Studied all facets of reporting news. Gained experience in techniques of interviewing, information gathering and writing news stories for multimedia platforms. 
          </li>
          <li><strong>COM 322: Digital News Journalism</strong><br>
            Did journalistic writing along with other aspects of writing for digital media, and management of news in a digital culture, to combine efforts in developing those student-directed skills.
